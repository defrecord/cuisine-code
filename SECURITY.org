* Security Policy and Considerations

This document outlines the security policies, practices, and considerations for the Cuisine Code project.

** Scope

The security policy covers:
- Application code and dependencies
- User authentication and authorization
- Data protection and privacy
- API security
- Infrastructure security
- Incident response

** Security Design Principles

** Authentication and Authorization

*** OAuth Implementation
- Secure token handling
- GitHub OAuth integration
- Google OAuth integration
- Authorization scopes and permissions
- Secure session management

*** User Permissions
- Role-based access control
- Principle of least privilege
- Resource ownership validation
- Permission auditing

** Data Protection

*** User Data
- Personal identifiable information (PII) minimization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure storage practices
- Data retention policies
- GDPR and privacy law compliance

*** Recipe and Kitchen Data
- Access control for shared recipes
- Validation of recipe content
- Protection against malicious recipe content

** API Security

*** Endpoint Protection
- Rate limiting
- API key validation
- Request validation
- Input sanitization

*** CSRF Protection
- Token-based CSRF prevention
- SameSite cookie settings
- Origin validation

*** XSS Prevention
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Output encoding
- Input validation and sanitization

** Infrastructure Security

*** Server Hardening
- Minimal service exposure
- Regular updates and patches
- Security configuration baselines
- File system permissions

*** Network Security
- Firewall configuration
- TLS implementation
- Network segregation
- Proxy considerations

** Dependency Management

*** Dependency Validation
- Regular audit of dependencies
- Version pinning
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- License compliance

*** Build Process Security
- Integrity verification
- Secure compilation flags
- Build server security

** WebAssembly Security

*** Browser Sandbox
- Understanding WASM security boundaries
- Memory isolation
- Safe API exposure

*** WASM-specific Considerations
- Data validation at WASM boundaries
- Memory management security
- Secure function exposure

** Vulnerability Management

*** Reporting Process
- Vulnerability disclosure policy
- Security contact information
- Response timeline commitments
- Bug bounty considerations

*** Scanning and Testing
- Regular automated scanning
- Penetration testing schedule
- Code review processes
- Static analysis implementation

** Incident Response
