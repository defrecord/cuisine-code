Cuisine Code is an educational game that teaches stack-based computing concepts through French culinary metaphors. By interacting with a virtual kitchen, players learn fundamental programming concepts in an engaging and intuitive way.

** Overview

In Cuisine Code, cooking procedures are modeled as stack operations:
- Ingredients are pushed onto the stack
- Cooking transformations pop ingredients, process them, and push results back
- Recipes combine multiple operations to create complex dishes
- Players learn computational thinking through familiar culinary concepts

The game is implemented in Scheme and transpiled to multiple target platforms, including C, WebAssembly, and JavaScript for broad accessibility.

** Key Features

- *Stack-Based Operations*: Learn fundamental computing concepts through cooking
- *French Culinary Focus*: Master authentic techniques from mirepoix to mother sauces
- *Visual Feedback*: See your stack operations through beautiful culinary visualizations
- *Progressive Learning*: Advance from simple preparations to complex recipes
- *Social Cooking*: Share recipes and cook collaboratively (v4.0)
- *Cross-Platform*: Play in your terminal or browser
