* Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for Cuisine Code, including planned features, milestones, and release schedule.

** Overview

Cuisine Code will be developed and released in four major versions, each building upon the previous one to create a comprehensive stack-based learning environment through French culinary metaphors.
